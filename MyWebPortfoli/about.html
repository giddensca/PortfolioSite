          <p>
            Hi, my name is Chancynn Giddens. I am currently a college student
            enrolled at the University of Saint Francis in Indiana. I'm majoring
            in Game and Application Development with a minor in Music Tech. I've
            been learning code for approximately the last 3 years. Web
            development is something I'm new to but the website you see before
            you was coded by me and laid out by me. It's a proof of concept. I'm
            looking to have a career in programming of all different types. I
            work diligently and will always be quick to contact with questions
            for clients. Will work to satisfy the needs of a customer as long as
            everything has been discussed an agreed upon. Overall communication
            is key to me.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
            The languages I have learned the most about currently include CSS,
            HTML, and C#. CSS and HTML have been self-taught while C# is the
            language my current courses have been using in school. I've also
            taken classes that have introduced me to Java and Javascript and
            I've even taken a full course on Visual Basic. There are many more
            lanuages I'd love to get a better understanding of, however, one
            step at a time.
          </p>

            <h3>My Web Design and Development Experience</h3>
            <p>
              I'm currently creating websites in my free time to help expand my
              skills and knowledge in coding. This is a website I've created to
              help demonstrate some of the skills I have already acquired. If
              you have any questions about what else I'm able to do with HTML
              and CSS you can email me with the information provided on my
              contact page.
